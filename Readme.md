# Draw

Draw is an application created entirely with the Wolfram Language. It was designed to produce 2D and 3D technical illustrations.

### Using Draw

Open the Draw.nb file and evaluate draw[]; which is located in the Using Draw section. After Draw opens, click the blue help button for basic information. Hover over any button of the Draw interface to display a tooltip describing its functionality.

### Draw development

Draw was developed as a personal project by Tim Shedelbower of Wolfram Research. It is used regularly to create illustrations found throughout the Wolfram Language documentation and examples.
